# Diabetes, Hypertension, and Stroke Prediction

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes, hypertension, and stroke. We employ the Python library Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for both patients and doctors. The application provides predictions based on user inputs, offering insights and recommendations to improve health outcomes.

## Dataset

We used the "Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset" from Kaggle, which includes three subsets for diabetes, hypertension, and stroke, each containing relevant health indicators and demographic information.

- **Diabetes**: 70,692 rows, 18 features
- **Hypertension**: 26,058 rows, 14 features
- **Stroke**: 40,907 rows, 11 features

## How to Run the Application

1. Install Streamlit:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
	'''

2. Run the application:
streamlit run app_name.py

3. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can access the app by visiting http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

## Use Case

The application is designed to assist both patients and healthcare professionals by providing:
- **Predictive Models**: Accurately forecast the likelihood of diabetes, hypertension, and stroke.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Offer insights into health indicators and behaviors.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Empower users to take proactive measures for better health outcomes.

Steps:
1. Python Library for dynamic Frontend - Streamlit
2. Models from Colab Notebook are first loaded in the pickle file and are then used by the streamlit app to give predictions based on user inputs file
3. How to run:
	a. pip install streamlit
	b. streamlit run app_name.py
4. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can access the app by visiting http://localhost:8501 in your web browser
